# Data Science Deliberate Practice Plan 

## Motivation
There's a lot written on how to break into data science, but not a lot written on how to become a *better* data scientist. From reading Sequoia Capital's [levels of a data scientist](https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/progression-of-a-data-scientist-e1bebf8c8420) and from conversations with my manager, I've started to paint a picture of what the progression of a data scientist looks like. I've also started to get a feel for where I sit in terms of leveling. 

Across the industry, the levels of an IC data scientist generally look like this:

**Level 1: Execution**: Primarily focused on **execution**, a level one data scientist typically will: 
- Need a manager or senior data scientist to scope 70 to 80% of the project
- Primarily focus on executing what the spec requires, with little error 
- Reactive in terms of requests. For example, a business partner might define the ask and the level 1 data scientist would complete the task. 
- Lack domain expertise of a specific area 

**Level 2: Independence**:
- Domain Expertise on a single product area and able to influence product roadmap
- Require little to no assistance from a senior DS, manager
- Can work fully independently, with no assistance from a manager, to drive a project forward with a business partner
- Capable of scoping a vague, general problem, 90% of a project and executing 100%. 
- Able to effectively translate the output of a model into business recommendations 

**Level 3: Mentorship**:
- Thought of as a thought partner with business partners within domain. Able to influence the product roadmap and lead discussions. 
- Able to apply domain expertise on a single product area to multiple domains. 

We assume that each subsequent level will contain all the skills of the previous level.

## Current Assessment 
Looking at myself, I sit in between level one and level two. Right now, I've identified multiple gaps in my skillset to progress from level one to level two: 

**Technical Skills**:

**Influence/Leadership**:

**Problem Formulation**:

### Programming 

**Current Assessment/Level:**

**Objective/Outcome:**

1. Speed
- Purpose is to write programs faster, more efficiently 
- The best way to practice this will be to repeatedly complete challenges, timed
and then review the best solutions. 

2. Defensive Programming
- Purpose is to eliminate bugs/errors 
- Writing unit tests 

3. Clean Code 
- Write legible, re-useable code 

4. Modular Code

Distributed Computing 

Git

Linux Commands 

Spaced Repetition on Core Concepts 

### Machine Learning 
**Current Assessment/Level:**

Purpose: 
- Increase the breadth of techniques in my toolbox

- Either write the code or write the blog post + math from memory with needing to peak. Using active re-call.
