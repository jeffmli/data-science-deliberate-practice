# Data Science Deliberate Practice Plan 

## Motivation
There's a lot written on how to break into data science. There's a lot written on new techniques. There isn't a lot written on how to become a *better* data scientist. Being a data scientist is so much more than machine learning algorithms and techniques. Techniques are *tools* we use to reach a larger goal: **positively impacting the business**. Learning the technical skills is just the first step. 

From reading Sequoia Capital's [levels of a data scientist](https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/progression-of-a-data-scientist-e1bebf8c8420) and from conversations with my manager, I've started to paint a picture of what the progression of a data scientist looks like. By painting this picture, this gives me a path to progress. 

Across the industry, the levels of an IC data scientist generally look like this:

**Level 1 - Execution**: A level one data scientist typically will typically: 

*Technical* - Capable of applying different ML algorithms to different problems, manipulating data in Python, SQL and running basic statistical analysis with some oversight.

*Independence* - Primarily focused on execution in tandem with a Senior DS or Manager. 

*Problem Formulation* - Will require a well-defined problem from a business partner or manager. 

*Influence/Leadership* - Percieved to have high standards of execution, with error-free analysis. Business partners trust this person to produce quality work.

**Level 2 - Independence**:

*Technical* - Capable of producing an end-to-end ML solution with little oversight from Sr DS, while also contributing new technical tooling for the team. 

*Independence* - Can independently lead communication with business partners and own this area with little assistance. 

*Problem Formulation* - Capable of taking a loosely defined problem from the business and break it down into an execute-able roadmap. 

*Influence/Leadership* - Capable of influencing decision-making with knowledge of the product/part of the business. 

**Level 3 - Mentorship**:

*Technical* - Applies more advanced techniques/concepts to multiple problems while writing elegant, re-producable code. Should be capable of writing their own packages. 

*Independence* - Tend to be paired with a junior DS to be a mentor. Strong knowledge of multiple areas, which allows them to capture synergies between the business. 

*Problem Formulation* - Develops the project roadmap to hit goals set by executive teams. 

*Influence/Leadership* - Thought partner with Product Managers on area of expertise. Work side-by-side with business partners to develop roadmap. 

We assume that each subsequent level will contain all the skills of the previous level.

## Current Assessment 
For me to progress, it's important to do a gap analysis on my current skills. By identifying the gaps, I can develop a plan that specifically fills these gaps. 

**Technical Skills**
Areas for Improvement:
- Producing error-free analysis, significantly reducing the frequency of bugs (Level 1). 
- Understand how to increase the speed of my code so I can provide results quickly(Level 1). 

**Influence/Leadership**
Areas for Improvement:
- Become a domain expert within a specific product area (Level 2). 
- Begin influencing decisions within a product (Level 2). 

**Problem Formulation**:
Areas for Improvement:
- Take a vague, undefined problem and break it down into a concrete roadmap (Level 2). 

**Independence**:
Areas for Improvement:
- Independently handle conversations with business partners.

Conducting my own gap analysis, the most important thing for me is to **reduce the frequency of bugs** within my code and **increase the speed at which I produce results.** 


## Performance Outcomes

## Skill De-Construction 

### Programming 

**Current Assessment/Level:**

**Objective/Outcome:**

1. Speed
- Purpose is to write programs faster, more efficiently 
- The best way to practice this will be to repeatedly complete challenges, timed
and then review the best solutions. 

2. Defensive Programming
- Purpose is to eliminate bugs/errors 
- Writing unit tests 

3. Clean Code 
- Write legible, re-useable code 

4. Modular Code

PEP8 Standards 

Advanced Python Functions

Distributed Computing 

Git

Linux Commands 

Spaced Repetition on Core Concepts 

### Machine Learning 
**Current Assessment/Level:**

Purpose: 
- Increase the breadth of techniques in my toolbox
- Either write the code or write the blog post + math from memory with needing to peak. Using active re-call.
