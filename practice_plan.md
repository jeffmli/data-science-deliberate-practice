## Performance Outcomes
Now that I've identified the gaps, I'll need to translate these into performance-based outcomes:

### Technical Skills
**1. Incorporate the principles of defensive programming into my workflow**: Defensive programming include asserts, logging, and unit tests. This is important because producing error-free analysis is what will build trust with partners while opening up more opportunities for future projects. 

**2. Accelerate code speed**: Improving code speed will be broken down into a few components:
- Get better at translating logic into code 
- Understanding different Python runtimes under the hood
- Distributed Computing 

### Influence/Leadership/Independence
**3. Decide on the business area of focus**: This will require more thinking & experimentation. 

## Project Outcomes 

## Skill De-Construction 
**1. Clean, Pythonic Code - Incorporate PEP8 Standards into my coding [1 week]** - Key here will be to remove bad habits from my programming, make my code legible and easy to understand.

*Method of Learning - Read Clean Python + Active Recall on concepts by writing up my own example. 

**2. Writing Better Functions/Classes [1 week]** - Improve the quality, effectiveness of the functions, classes I write.

*Method of Learning - Read Clean Python + Active Recall on concepts by writing my own program. 

**3. Debugging/Testing in Python ** - Key here will be to reduce the number of errors in my code.

**4. Decorators & Context Managers** - Improve functions by incorporating decorators into my workflow

**5. Generators & Iterators ** 

Memorize until it's habitual. 

Need a way to memorize it and apply it. 

Good Project would be to write a package. 

### Programming 

**Current Assessment/Level:**

## Resources
- Writing Clean Code in Python Book 

**Objective/Outcome:**

1. Speed
- Purpose is to write programs faster, more efficiently 
- The best way to practice this will be to repeatedly complete challenges, timed
and then review the best solutions. 

2. Defensive Programming
- Purpose is to eliminate bugs/errors 
- Writing unit tests 

3. Clean Code 
- Write legible, re-useable code 

4. Modular Code

PEP8 Standards 

Advanced Python Functions

Distributed Computing 

Git

Linux Commands 

Spaced Repetition on Core Concepts 

### Machine Learning 
**Current Assessment/Level:**

Purpose: 
- Increase the breadth of techniques in my toolbox
- Either write the code or write the blog post + math from memory with needing to peak. Using active re-call.
