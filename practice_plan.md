## Performance Outcomes
Now that I've identified the gaps, I'll need to translate these into performance-based outcomes:

### Technical Skills
**1. Incorporate the principles of defensive programming into my workflow**: Defensive programming include asserts, logging, and unit tests. This is important because producing error-free analysis is what will build trust with partners while opening up more opportunities for future projects. 

**2. Accelerate code speed**: Improving code speed will be broken down into a few components:
- Get better at translating logic into code 
- Understanding different Python runtimes under the hood
- Distributed Computing 

### Influence/Leadership/Independence
**3. Decide on the business area of focus**: This will require more thinking & experimentation. 

## Project Outcomes 

## Skill De-Construction 
**1. Clean, Pythonic Code - Incorporate PEP8 Standards into my coding [1 week]** - Key here will be to remove bad habits from my programming, make my code legible and easy to understand.
